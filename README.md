# WEB103 Prework - Creatorverse

Submitted by: Patrick Biedermann

About this web app: This project is a simple website made using react on the frontend and supabase as the backend. It suports basic CRUD features. Any user can go on the website and view creators, add a creator, delete a creator, and update a creator.

Time spent: ~5 hours

## Notes
This was my first time using supabase, but I found the experience very pleasant. The walkthrough made it so I knew what direction to go in and the supabase JS documentation is phenomenal. One issue I struggled with was uploading images, which I figured out how to do with supabase buckets eventually. The project overall was simple as I have a fair amount of experience working with react and nothing, but supabase, was new to me. Thank you for considering me for this program and I look forward to the upcoming lessons and projects. I considered creating custom hooks for repetitive actions such as fetching users, but decided against it as I believe that may be too much for this task. If I was planning on working on this project further (which the course may do, and in that case I would create custom hooks) I would create features such as custom hooks to keep it more maintainable. Another thing to note is that the react project is not built and still in dev form, as the instructions did not specific to build.
